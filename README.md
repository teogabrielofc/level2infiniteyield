## FAQ

Q: Why is this based on v5.1?
A: Because the last version gives a nill error, but v5.1 only has CoreGui. But i am trying to port the last version.

Q: Why does it get stuck when I open it?
A: I don't know either, so rejoin and run again.

Q: Why when I put the command in the chat it doesn't go?
A: It only supports legacy chat, it doesn't work on the new one.
